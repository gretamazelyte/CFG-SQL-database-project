Our database and analysis include:

- Created a medical database that stored 9 tables (see DB diagram file for visual representation);
- Populated the tables with randomly generated patient information and medical data;
- Produced codes for required tasks:
  - Query to find the heart rate and bp of female patients using medical report and patient information tables;
  - Group by code for matching the diagnosis and treatment given using patient diagnosis table;
  - Event code which updates patient consent table for clinical trial patients;
  - View that creates virtual table using patient trial table which is then inner joined with medical report, patient information using positive parameter.
- Created multiple examples of various joins using most of the tables;
- Produced a stored procedure that inserts new patient information into the patient_name table;
- Created a function that retrieves false positive results from the patient trial table.

Files included:

- Medical database code file;
- Data.SQL file which is our generated patient data;
- Code files for query, group by, event, view, function, joins, procedure.
- Diagram file of our database tables.
- Presentation that summarises and shows our work on this database.
